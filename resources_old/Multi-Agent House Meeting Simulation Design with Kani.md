# Multi-Agent House Meeting Simulation Design Document

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the design for a Multi-Agent House Meeting Simulation - an AI-powered social simulation where six distinct characters collaborate to make household decisions through natural dialogue and consensus-building. Built using a 2D JRPG visual style, the system demonstrates emergent group dynamics through autonomous AI agents powered by large language models.

**Key Innovation**: Unlike scripted simulations, this system generates authentic collaborative discussions where AI characters with distinct personalities naturally debate, compromise, and reach consensus on everyday household decisions.

### System Information Flow Description

#### Data Flow Patterns

**Initialization Flow**:
1. **Configuration Loading**: System loads character personalities, scenario definitions, and house environment settings
2. **Character Instantiation**: AI agents are created with their respective personality traits and initial goals
3. **Environment Setup**: House layout, objects, and initial character positions are established
4. **Scenario Activation**: Discussion topic is selected and context is distributed to all characters

**Discussion Cycle Flow**:
1. **Observation Phase**: Characters perceive current environment, other characters' states, and discussion context
2. **Memory Retrieval**: Relevant past experiences and relationship history are retrieved from memory systems
3. **Planning Phase**: Characters use LLM reasoning to formulate responses based on personality and context
4. **Action Execution**: Characters deliver dialogue, express opinions, and interact with the environment
5. **State Updates**: World state, character relationships, and memory systems are updated based on actions

**Consensus Detection Flow**:
1. **Opinion Aggregation**: System collects and analyzes character positions on current discussion topic
2. **Agreement Assessment**: Consensus detection algorithms evaluate level of group agreement
3. **Compromise Facilitation**: If needed, characters propose and evaluate compromise solutions
4. **Decision Finalization**: Once consensus is reached, decision is recorded and implemented

**Feedback Loops**:
- **Memory Integration**: New experiences influence future character behavior and decision-making
- **Relationship Evolution**: Character interactions affect trust levels and communication patterns
- **Adaptive Timing**: Discussion pacing adjusts based on character engagement and progress toward consensus

### Real-time Data Synchronization

#### Frontend-Backend Synchronization Protocol

**Character State Updates**:
- **Frequency**: 60 FPS for smooth animations, 10 Hz for state synchronization
- **Data Format**: JSON objects containing position, animation state, current dialogue, and emotional indicators
- **Compression**: Delta updates to minimize bandwidth usage
- **Priority System**: Critical updates (speech, consensus changes) get immediate transmission

**Discussion Progress Tracking**:
- **Consensus Meter**: Real-time calculation of group agreement levels based on character statements
- **Turn Indicators**: Visual feedback showing whose turn to speak and remaining time
- **Topic Progress**: Visual representation of discussion phase progression
- **Decision History**: Chronological display of key decision points and agreements

**Memory and Relationship Visualization**:
- **Relationship Graph**: Dynamic network diagram showing trust levels and influence patterns
- **Memory Highlights**: Visual indicators when characters reference past experiences
- **Emotional State Indicators**: Color-coded character sprites reflecting current mood
- **Consensus Evolution**: Timeline showing how group opinion changes over time

#### User Input Processing Pipeline

**Direct Interactions**:
1. **Input Capture**: Mouse clicks, keyboard shortcuts, and UI element interactions
2. **Validation**: Ensure user action is valid for current simulation state
3. **Backend Transmission**: Send validated action to appropriate backend service
4. **State Update**: Backend processes action and updates relevant system components
5. **UI Refresh**: Frontend receives updates and refreshes visual elements

**Influence Actions**:
1. **Constraint Definition**: User specifies type and parameters of environmental change
2. **Impact Assessment**: System evaluates how change affects character decision-making
3. **Character Notification**: Relevant characters are informed of new constraints
4. **Behavioral Adaptation**: Characters adjust their reasoning and dialogue accordingly
5. **Visual Feedback**: UI shows how influence action affected discussion dynamics
