# Text Adventure Games Framework: Your AI Agent Playground Backend

## Introduction: Why Text Adventures for AI Research?

Welcome to the `text_adventure_games` Python package - a framework that's about to become the brain of your multi-agent AI playground! While it started as a way to create interactive text-based adventure games, this framework is actually a perfect testbed for artificial intelligence research.

**Why are text adventures ideal for AI agents?** Think about it: when you play a text adventure, you're having a conversation with a computer about an imaginary world using natural language. You read descriptions, form mental models of unseen environments, plan multi-step actions, and learn from trial and error. These are exactly the skills we want AI agents to develop!

### What Makes This Framework Special for AI?

**Natural Language Interface**: Unlike most game engines that require complex APIs, this framework accepts plain English commands like "go north" or "give apple to troll." This means Large Language Models (LLMs) can interact directly without needing translation layers.

**Rich World Representation**: Every object, location, and character has detailed text descriptions that LLMs can understand and reason about. Instead of abstract coordinates, agents work with meaningful concepts like "a rusty key on the wooden table."

**Structured Action Discovery**: The framework can tell agents exactly what actions are possible at any moment, preventing AI hallucination and improving learning efficiency.

**Observable Decision Making**: Every action an AI agent takes is visible as a natural language command, making it easy to understand, debug, and study AI reasoning processes.

**Turn-Based Coordination**: Perfect for managing multiple AI agents without race conditions or timing complexity.

### Your Multi-Agent Playground Architecture

This framework will serve as the **backend** of your project:
- **Python Backend**: Handles all game logic, world state, and AI agent coordination
- **Godot Frontend**: Provides 2D JRPG-style visualization of the abstract world
- **LLM Integration**: Powers intelligent agents using libraries like Kani
- **Event System**: Keeps frontend synchronized with backend changes

Let's explore how this framework works and why it's perfect for your AI research!

## Quick Start Tutorial: Building an AI-Friendly Game World

Let's create a simple game world that will be perfect for training AI agents. We'll build an environment where agents can learn basic skills like navigation, object manipulation, and goal achievement.

### Creating Your First AI Training Environment

The framework follows a simple but powerful pattern: create locations, items, characters, and actions, then wire them together into a world where AI agents can explore and learn.

```python
from text_adventure_games import games, things

# Create locations - each represents a "state" in your AI agent's world
cottage = things.Location(
    "Cottage", 
    "A cozy cottage with a warm fireplace crackling in the corner."
)
garden = things.Location(
    "Garden", 
    "A lush garden filled with colorful flowers and the sound of buzzing bees."
)
forest = things.Location(
    "Dark Forest",
    "Tall trees block out most sunlight. You hear mysterious sounds in the distance."
)

# Connect locations to create navigable world
# These connections define the "action space" for movement
cottage.add_connection("out", garden)
garden.add_connection("north", forest)
forest.add_connection("south", garden)
garden.add_connection("in", cottage)

# Create items with different properties - perfect for testing AI reasoning
lamp = things.Item("lamp", "a brass lamp", "A shiny brass lamp that looks antique.")
lamp.set_property("gettable", True)
lamp.set_property("light_source", True)
cottage.add_item(lamp)

# Create complex items that test decision-making
mushroom = things.Item("mushroom", "a red mushroom", "A bright red mushroom. Is it safe to eat?")
mushroom.set_property("gettable", True)
mushroom.set_property("is_food", True)
mushroom.set_property("is_poisonous", True)  # Risk vs. reward decision!
forest.add_item(mushroom)

# Create the player character
player = things.Character(
    name="player",
    description="A curious explorer",
    persona="I love discovering new things and solving puzzles"
)

# Create an NPC for social reasoning challenges
hermit = things.Character(
    name="hermit",
    description="An old hermit with wise, knowing eyes",
    persona="I'm hungry and lonely, but I know many secrets about this forest"
)
hermit.set_property("is_hungry", True)
forest.add_character(hermit)

# Create and start the game
game = games.Game(cottage, player, characters=[hermit])
game.game_loop()  # For human testing
```

### What Makes This Perfect for AI Agents?

**Rich State Space**: Each location represents a different state with unique properties, items, and characters. AI agents must learn to navigate this space effectively.

**Complex Decision Making**: The poisonous mushroom creates a risk-reward scenario. Should an agent take it? Give it to someone? Ignore it? These decisions reveal intelligence.

**Social Reasoning**: The hungry hermit creates opportunities for social interaction. Smart agents might learn that giving food to hungry characters leads to rewards.

**Goal-Oriented Behavior**: Items like the lamp suggest purposes (lighting dark areas), encouraging agents to develop goal-oriented strategies.

### Basic Game Structure for AI Research

Every AI training environment needs:

1. **Locations**: Define the state space your agents will explore
   - *Why it matters*: Each location should offer different challenges and opportunities

2. **A Player Character**: The agent's avatar in the world
   - *Why it matters*: This is how your AI agent perceives and acts in the world

3. **Items**: Objects that test reasoning and planning
   - *Why it matters*: Item properties create complex decision scenarios

4. **NPCs**: Other characters for social interaction
   - *Why it matters*: Multi-agent scenarios emerge naturally from NPC interactions

5. **The Game Loop**: Manages the agent-environment interaction cycle
   - *Why it matters*: This is the core perception→decision→action→feedback loop of AI research

## Core Architecture: Built for AI Intelligence

The framework is designed around concepts that mirror how intelligent agents understand and interact with the world. This isn't accidental - it makes the framework naturally suited for AI research.

### Entity-Component-System Design

**Why This Architecture Matters for AI**: The framework models the world the way humans (and AI agents) naturally think about it - as objects with properties that can perform actions.

The main entity types are:

- **Things**: Base class for all game objects (locations, items, characters)
  - *AI Insight*: Everything in the world inherits from the same base, creating consistent interaction patterns that AI agents can learn

- **Properties**: Dynamic attributes that define behavior (is_gettable, is_food, is_locked)
  - *AI Insight*: Properties let agents reason about object capabilities without hardcoded rules

- **Actions**: Encapsulated behaviors that modify game state (Get, Drop, Give, Go)
  - *AI Insight*: Actions provide a structured way for agents to affect the world with clear preconditions and effects

- **Blocks**: Obstacles that prevent movement (locked doors, hostile guards)
  - *AI Insight*: Blocks create problem-solving scenarios where agents must find alternative approaches

## The Game Loop: The Heart of Agent-Environment Interaction

The game loop is where AI magic happens! This is the core agent-environment interaction cycle that's fundamental to AI research, implemented in `games.py:78-90`:

```python
def game_loop(self):
    """
    The classic agent-environment interaction loop:
    Observe → Decide → Act → Get Feedback → Repeat
    """
    self.parser.parse_command("look")  # Initial observation
    
    while True:
        command = input("\n> ")          # Agent decision (for now, human input)
        self.parser.parse_command(command)  # Execute action
        if self.is_game_over():          # Check termination
            break
```

### Why This Loop Is Perfect for AI Research

**The Agent-Environment Cycle**: This loop mirrors the fundamental pattern of intelligent behavior:
1. **Observe** the current state (initial "look" command)
2. **Decide** what action to take (command selection)
3. **Act** in the environment (command execution)
4. **Receive feedback** (game response and state change)
5. **Repeat** until goal achieved or environment terminates

**For Your Multi-Agent Playground**: Instead of `input()` from humans, your AI agents will use LLMs to generate commands based on their observations and goals.

### Game Loop Flow: From Human to AI Agent

**Current (Human) Flow**:
1. **Initialization**: Display initial location description
2. **Input Loop**:
   - Prompt user for command
   - Parse command through `Parser.parse_command()`
   - Route to appropriate `Action` class
   - Execute action if preconditions are met
   - Update game state
   - Check for game over conditions
3. **Termination**: Exit when `is_game_over()` returns True

**Future (AI Agent) Flow**:
1. **Initialization**: Provide world state to agent
2. **Agent Loop**:
   - Agent observes current world state
   - Agent reasons about possible actions
   - Agent selects optimal command using LLM
   - Parse and execute command
   - Update world state
   - Check for goal achievement or game over
3. **Termination**: Exit when objectives met or max turns reached

### Command Processing Pipeline: Natural Language Understanding

**Why This Pipeline Is AI-Friendly**: Each step maps to capabilities that modern LLMs excel at.

1. **Input**: Raw text command ("give apple to hermit")
   - *AI Advantage*: LLMs naturally generate human-like commands

2. **Intent Recognition**: `Parser.determine_intent()` identifies action type
   - *AI Advantage*: Clear mapping from natural language to structured actions

3. **Action Creation**: Instantiate appropriate `Action` subclass
   - *AI Advantage*: Consistent interface regardless of action complexity

4. **Precondition Check**: `Action.check_preconditions()` validates action
   - *AI Advantage*: Prevents impossible actions, helping agents learn valid behaviors

5. **Effect Application**: `Action.apply_effects()` modifies game state
   - *AI Advantage*: Clear cause-and-effect relationships help agents learn

6. **Response**: Descriptive text output describing results
   - *AI Advantage*: Rich feedback helps agents understand action consequences

---

## World Description System

The framework provides rich world description through several mechanisms:

### Location Description (`games.py:119-131`)

```python
def describe(self) -> str:
    """
    Describe the current game state by first describing the current
    location, then listing any exits, and then describing any objects
    in the current location.
    """
    description = self.player.location.name.upper() + "\n"
    description += self.describe_current_location() + "\n"
    description += self.describe_exits() + "\n"
    description += self.describe_items() + "\n"
    description += self.describe_characters() + "\n"
    return description
```

### Description Components

1. **Location Name**: Bold header identifying current location
2. **Location Description**: Narrative text describing the environment
3. **Exits**: Available directions and where they lead
4. **Items**: Objects present in the location with descriptions
5. **Characters**: NPCs present with their descriptions

### Dynamic Descriptions

The system supports dynamic descriptions that change based on:
- Character properties (emotional state, health, etc.)
- Item properties (lit/unlit, broken/intact, etc.)
- Location properties (dark/lit, visited/unvisited, etc.)
- Game state (time of day, weather, story progress, etc.)

---

## Action System

Actions are the core mechanism for player interaction with the game world.

### Action Architecture

All actions inherit from `actions.base.Action` and must implement:

```python
class Action:
    def check_preconditions(self) -> bool:
        """Validate that action can be performed"""
        return False
    
    def apply_effects(self):
        """Modify game state"""
        return self.parser.ok("no effect")
```

### Action Lifecycle

1. **Instantiation**: Created by Parser with game reference and command text
2. **Parsing**: Extract relevant entities (characters, items, locations)
3. **Precondition Check**: Validate action can be performed
4. **Effect Application**: Modify game state and generate response

### Built-in Actions

The framework provides these core actions:

#### Movement Actions (`actions/locations.py`)
- **Go**: Move between connected locations
- Handles direction parsing, connection validation, and block checking

#### Object Manipulation (`actions/things.py`)
- **Get**: Pick up items from location
- **Drop**: Place items from inventory to location
- **Give**: Transfer items between characters
- **Examine**: Get detailed item/character descriptions
- **Inventory**: List character's possessions

#### System Actions (`actions/base.py`)
- **Describe**: Re-describe current location
- **Quit**: End the game
- **ActionSequence**: Execute comma-separated command chains

### Custom Actions

Games can define custom actions by subclassing `Action`:

```python
class Unlock_Door(actions.Action):
    ACTION_NAME = "unlock door"
    ACTION_DESCRIPTION = "Unlock a door with a key"
    
    def __init__(self, game, command):
        super().__init__(game)
        self.character = self.parser.get_character(command)
        self.key = self.parser.match_item("key", ...)
        self.door = self.parser.match_item("door", ...)
    
    def check_preconditions(self) -> bool:
        # Validate door exists, is locked, character has key, etc.
        return all_conditions_met
    
    def apply_effects(self):
        # Unlock the door, provide feedback
        self.door.set_property("is_locked", False)
        self.parser.ok("Door unlocked!")
```

---

## Multi-Agent Integration

### Framework Adaptability

The framework is designed to support multi-agent scenarios through several key features:

#### Character-Centric Actions

All actions take a character parameter, allowing any character to perform actions:

```python
# Player action
action = Get(game, "player get lamp")

# NPC action  
action = Get(game, "guard get sword")
```

#### Flexible Command Processing

The parser can process commands for any character:

```python
# Parse commands from different agents
parser.parse_command("alice go north")
parser.parse_command("bob take key")
parser.parse_command("charlie attack troll")
```

#### State Management

The game maintains complete world state, allowing multiple agents to:
- Share the same world
- Interact with each other
- Affect the same objects and locations
- Observe each other's actions

### Multi-Agent Extensions: Building Your AI Playground

Here's how to transform this single-player framework into a multi-agent AI research platform. These extensions will turn your text adventure into a sophisticated testbed for artificial intelligence:

#### Agent Manager: Connecting AI Brains to Game Bodies

The Agent Manager bridges the gap between your AI agents (the "brains") and the game characters (the "bodies").

```python
class AgentManager:
    """Manages multiple AI agents operating in the same world"""
    def __init__(self, game):
        self.game = game
        self.agents = {}  # agent_id -> agent configuration
    
    def register_agent(self, agent_id, character, llm_planner):
        """Connect an AI agent to a game character"""
        self.agents[agent_id] = {
            'character': character,     # The character in the game world
            'planner': llm_planner,     # The AI that makes decisions
            'active': True,             # Whether this agent takes turns
            'goals': [],                # Agent's objectives
            'memory': []                # Agent's experience history
        }
    
    def execute_turn(self, agent_id, world_state):
        """Let an agent take one action"""
        agent = self.agents[agent_id]
        
        # AI agent observes the world and decides what to do
        plan = agent['planner'].generate_plan(world_state)
        command = agent['planner'].select_action(plan)
        
        # Execute the command in the game world
        result = self.game.parser.parse_command(command)
        
        # Update agent's memory with the experience
        agent['memory'].append({
            'state': world_state,
            'action': command,
            'result': result
        })
        
        return result
```

**Why This Matters**: This design lets you experiment with different AI approaches (rule-based, reinforcement learning, LLM-based) while keeping the game logic unchanged.

#### World State API: What Can AI Agents See?

This API gives agents exactly the information they need to make intelligent decisions, formatted in a way that LLMs can easily understand.

```python
def get_world_state_for_agent(self, agent_character):
    """
    Return rich world state that an AI agent can reason about.
    This is like giving the agent 'eyes' to see their environment.
    """
    location = agent_character.location
    
    return {
        # Where am I?
        'location': {
            'name': location.name,
            'description': location.description,
            'visited_before': location.has_been_visited
        },
        
        # What am I carrying?
        'inventory': [
            {
                'name': item.name,
                'description': item.description,
                'properties': item.properties
            }
            for item in agent_character.inventory.values()
        ],
        
        # Who else is here?
        'visible_characters': [
            {
                'name': char.name,
                'description': char.description,
                'seems_friendly': not char.get_property('is_hostile', False)
            }
            for char in location.characters.values()
            if char != agent_character
        ],
        
        # What can I interact with?
        'visible_items': [
            {
                'name': item.name,
                'description': item.description,
                'can_take': item.get_property('gettable', False),
                'seems_useful': item.get_property('is_tool', False)
            }
            for item in location.items.values()
        ],
        
        # Where can I go?
        'available_exits': [
            {
                'direction': direction,
                'destination': destination.name,
                'is_blocked': location.is_blocked(direction, agent_character)
            }
            for direction, destination in location.connections.items()
        ],
        
        # What actions make sense here?
        'suggested_actions': self.get_available_actions_for_agent(agent_character)
    }
```

**Why This Rich State Matters**: LLMs can reason much better when they have context. Instead of just "lamp", the agent sees "a brass lamp that can be taken and might be useful for lighting dark areas."

#### Turn Management: Coordinating AI Agents

The Turn Manager ensures multiple AI agents can operate in the same world without chaos, creating orderly multi-agent scenarios.

```python
class TurnManager:
    """Coordinates multiple AI agents taking turns in a shared world"""
    def __init__(self, game, agents):
        self.game = game
        self.agents = agents
        self.turn_order = list(agents.keys())
        self.current_turn = 0
        self.round_number = 0
    
    def execute_round(self):
        """Let each agent take one action, in order"""
        self.round_number += 1
        
        for agent_id in self.turn_order:
            if not self.game.is_game_over():
                # Give agent current world state
                world_state = self.get_world_state_for_agent(agent_id)
                
                # Let agent decide and act
                self.execute_agent_turn(agent_id, world_state)
                
                # Check if this action achieved any goals
                self.check_agent_goals(agent_id)
                
                # Brief pause for dramatic effect (and Godot visualization)
                time.sleep(0.5)
    
    def add_random_events(self):
        """Inject unexpected events to test agent adaptability"""
        if random.random() < 0.1:  # 10% chance per round
            # Weather changes, new items appear, NPCs move, etc.
            self.inject_random_event()
```

**Research Value**: Turn-based coordination lets you study agent interaction patterns, cooperation, competition, and emergent behaviors without the complexity of real-time synchronization.

### Integration with Godot Frontend: Bringing AI to Life

The framework's design makes it perfect for creating visual representations of AI agent behavior. Your Godot frontend will be the "window" into the AI agents' world.

```python
# Export rich game state for Godot visualization
def export_for_godot(self):
    return {
        'world_state': self.game.to_json(),
        'agent_locations': {
            agent_id: agent['character'].location.name 
            for agent_id, agent in self.agents.items()
        },
        'recent_actions': self.get_recent_action_events(),
        'agent_thoughts': {
            agent_id: agent['planner'].last_reasoning
            for agent_id, agent in self.agents.items()
        }
    }

# Sync Godot visualization with AI decisions
def sync_with_frontend(self):
    """Send updates to Godot so players can watch AI agents think and act"""
    frontend_data = self.export_for_godot()
    self.godot_interface.update_visualization(frontend_data)

**Why This Integration Is Powerful**: Students can literally watch AI agents learning and making decisions in real-time, making abstract AI concepts concrete and observable.

### Recommended Architecture: Your Complete AI Playground

Here's how all the pieces fit together to create a sophisticated AI research platform:

1. **Text Adventure Backend** (This Framework): 
   - Manages world state and rules
   - Validates all agent actions
   - Provides rich, language-based environment

2. **AI Agent Layer** (Your Research Focus):
   - LLM-powered decision making (using Kani)
   - Different agent personalities and goals
   - Learning and adaptation mechanisms

3. **Turn Coordination System**:
   - Manages multiple agents fairly
   - Prevents conflicts and race conditions
   - Enables complex multi-agent scenarios

4. **Event Stream for Visualization**:
   - Real-time updates to Godot frontend
   - Action logging for research analysis
   - State synchronization across systems

5. **Godot 2D Frontend** (Your Creative Expression):
   - Visual representation of abstract world
   - JRPG-style sprites with state animations
   - Real-time visualization of AI decision-making

**Research Opportunities This Enables**:
- **Agent Communication**: How do agents learn to cooperate?
- **Emergent Behavior**: What unexpected strategies arise?
- **Transfer Learning**: Do skills learned in one scenario transfer to others?
- **Social Intelligence**: How do agents model other agents' mental states?
- **Goal Achievement**: What planning strategies work best?

This framework provides the perfect foundation for exploring these questions because it combines the language understanding of modern AI with the structured world modeling that enables complex, multi-step reasoning tasks.
