        This function allows your character agent to navigate in a 2D coordinate space.
        Follow these guidelines for optimal movement behavior:
        
        COORDINATE SYSTEM:
        - Use integer coordinates only: [x, y] format
        - X-axis: horizontal movement (positive = right, negative = left)
        - Y-axis: vertical movement (positive = up, negative = down)
        - Origin [0, 0] is typically at the bottom-left or center of the grid
        - Always provide coordinates as a list of two integers: [x, y]
        
        MOVEMENT STRATEGY:
        Focus on HOW you move rather than just WHERE you move. The manner of movement is everything - 
        it reveals your character's personality, emotional state, intentions, and current circumstances.
        
        EMOJI SELECTION FOR MOVEMENT MANNER:
        The emoji is the soul of your movement. Choose it to paint a vivid picture of HOW your character is moving:
        
        PACE AND ENERGY LEVELS:
        - 🚶 Casual stroll - relaxed, unhurried, observing surroundings
        - 🚶‍♂️ Determined walk - purposeful stride, focused forward movement
        - 🏃 Urgent run - time-sensitive, slightly out of breath, quick steps
        - 🏃‍♀️ Athletic sprint - powerful, coordinated, maximum speed
        - 🐌 Slow creep - cautious, deliberate, trying not to be noticed
        - ⚡ Lightning dash - sudden burst, explosive movement, startling speed
        - 🦶 Tiptoeing - silent, careful, avoiding detection or disturbance
        - 🕺 Bouncy step - energetic, rhythmic, possibly dancing while moving

        - 🤔 Thoughtful pace - measured steps, pausing occasionally, contemplative
        - 😴 Weary trudge - dragging feet, shoulders slumped, low energy

        - 🥺 Reluctant drift - doesn't really want to go, slow, looking back
        - 😏 Sneaky slink - mischievous, keeping to shadows, up to something
        
        SITUATIONAL MOVEMENT STYLES:
        - 🔍 Investigative prowl - alert, scanning, ready to stop and examine
        - 🎯 Focused beeline - direct, unwavering, tunnel vision toward goal

        - 🎪 Playful bound - joyful, unpredictable, maybe hopping or skipping
        - 🤝 Social approach - friendly, open body language, inviting

        - 🦝 Mischief sneak - playful stealth, up to harmless trouble
        - 🐱 Cat prowl - graceful, silent, predatory awareness
        - 🦉 Wise observation - moving to better vantage points, studying
        
        SOCIAL MOVEMENT EXPRESSIONS:

        - 🙈 Embarrassed scurry - trying to avoid attention, head down
        - 🤗 Welcoming approach - arms slightly open, warm invitation
        - 💔 Heartbroken wander - aimless, heavy, emotionally lost
        - 🎉 Celebratory dance-walk - can't contain joy, rhythm in every step
        
        USAGE EXAMPLES:
        - move([5, 3], "😰") - Nervously shuffle to (5, 3), hesitant and looking around
        - move([10, 8], "🎯") - March with focused determination toward (10, 8), unwavering
        - move([0, 0], "😴") - Trudge wearily home to origin, shoulders slumped, exhausted

        - move([1, 9], "🎉") - Dance-walk joyfully to (1, 9), rhythm in every step
        
        BEST PRACTICES:
        - Think like an actor: HOW would your character move in this emotional state?
        - The emoji should tell a story about your character's inner world
        - Match movement style to current circumstances and personality
        - Consider what your body language communicates to others
        - Let the manner of movement reveal character development and plot
        - Use movement as a form of non-verbal storytelling
        - Choose emojis that would make sense if someone was watching your character

        This function allows your character to engage with objects in the environment.
        Focus on HOW you interact rather than just WHAT you interact with. The manner of interaction is everything -

        OBJECT INTERACTION PRINCIPLES:
        - object: Be specific about what you're interacting with (e.g., "red_door", "wooden_chest", "glowing_crystal")
        - new_state: Describe the intended result clearly (e.g., "opened", "lit", "activated", "broken", "repaired")

        - Events that fundamentally change your character
        - Profound emotional experiences
        - Life-threatening or life-saving situations
        
        FACTORS TO CONSIDER:

        - Consequences: Will this event influence your future actions?
        - Relationships: Does this significantly affect your connections with others?
        - Goal relevance: Does this help or hinder your personal objectives?
        
        EXAMPLES:
