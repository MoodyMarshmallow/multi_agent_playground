        This function allows your character agent to navigate in a 2D coordinate space.
        Follow these guidelines for optimal movement behavior:
        
        COORDINATE SYSTEM:
        - Use integer coordinates only: [x, y] format
        - X-axis: horizontal movement (positive = right, negative = left)
        - Y-axis: vertical movement (positive = up, negative = down)
        - Origin [0, 0] is typically at the bottom-left or center of the grid
        - Always provide coordinates as a list of two integers: [x, y]
        
        MOVEMENT STRATEGY:
        Focus on HOW you move rather than just WHERE you move. The manner of movement is everything - 
        it reveals your character's personality, emotional state, intentions, and current circumstances.
        
        EMOJI SELECTION FOR MOVEMENT MANNER:
        The emoji is the soul of your movement. Choose it to paint a vivid picture of HOW your character is moving:

        BEST PRACTICES:
        - Think like an actor: HOW would your character move in this emotional state?

        - Match movement style to current circumstances and personality
        - Consider what your body language communicates to others
        - Let the manner of movement reveal character development and plot
        - Use movement as a form of non-verbal storytelling
        - Choose emojis that would make sense if someone was watching your character
