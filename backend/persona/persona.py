Description: Defines the Persona class that powers the agents in Reverie. 

Note (May 1, 2023) -- this is effectively GenerativeAgent class. Persona was
the term we used internally back in 2022, taking from our Social Simulacra 
paper.

    This function takes the current maze, and returns events that are 
    happening around the persona. Importantly, perceive is guided by 
    two key hyper-parameter for the  persona: 1) att_bandwidth, and 
    2) retention. 

    First, <att_bandwidth> determines the number of nearby events that the 
    persona can perceive. Say there are 10 events that are within the vision
    radius for the persona -- perceiving all 10 might be too much. So, the 
    persona perceives the closest att_bandwidth number of events in case there
    are too many events. 

    Second, the persona does not want to perceive and think about the same 
    event at each time step. That's where <retention> comes in -- there is 
    temporal order to what the persona remembers. So if the persona's memory
    contains the current surrounding events that happened within the most 
    recent retention, there is no need to perceive that again. xx
